### About


A bar graph made with d3.js following the below listed requirements:
* The X axis is a - z. Y axis is -10 to 90 ( bars can be below x axis ). 
* X axis does not have any ticks.
* Instead of dropdown in the example, there is an input box that accepts a number. The range is (0 to 10). By default it is 5. This number can be used as a seed to create random numbers between -10 to 90. for a - z bars. Use stock js random functions.
* When the input changes, the bars should animate(for eg going from 40 to 70, we should see the bar increase in height) to reach the new height. It is not that bad in d3.

1. Run npm install 
2. Run npm start
3. You should be able to see the barchart!
